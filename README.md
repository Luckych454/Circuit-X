# Citcuit-x

A simple circuit software.

## Enivorment

- this software running on unbuntu.

- this software using ncurses, make sure your computer has support ncurses already.

- the size of window is **43*132**,please resize you terminal before you use it.

NEW type position
```

to new a gate or display(e.g. NEW AND 10,10)

```
CONN position(out) position(in)
```

to connect outinterface and ininterface(e.g. CONN 0,0 10,10)

```
DISCONN position(out) position(in)
```

to disconnect outinterface and ininterface(e.g. DSICONN 0,0 10,10)

```
LIST
```

list all commands you have input(so that you can copy them to a file and save them)
